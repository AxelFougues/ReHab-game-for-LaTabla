This is an adaptation of the ReHab game for the Tablaviva. This minigame aims at visualising the human impact on the ecosystem:

Each game turn represents a year.

Each game turn is as follows:

  birds arrive on area and nest;
  park managers select up to three cells to be classified as a protected area (from the second round only);
  the harvesters are positioned on the grid;
  where breeding conditions were favorable, newborn birds appear;
  the results are communicated to the players;
  the biomass of the resource is updated.

Two scenarios are played: the first without communication between players; the second with communication. Each scenario consists of five rounds.
